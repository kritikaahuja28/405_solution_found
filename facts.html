Key facts</h1>

<li>In 1800 the health conditions of our ancestors were such that 43% of the world's newborns died before their 5th birthday. </li>
<li>In 1960 child mortality was still 18.5%. Almost every 5th child born in that year died in childhood.</li>
<li>An estimated 6.3 million children under the age of 15 years died in 2017. 5.4 million of them were under the age of 5 and 2.5 million of those children died within the first month of life. This translates into 15 000 under-five deaths per day.</li>
